## Purpose
This was created as part of a lesson from [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

The goal of this project was to have a website that allowed users to create and join events.

## Thoughts
This project highlighted to me the power of rails associations, after correctly setting up the models it was mostly trivial to get the rest of the functionality in place.
